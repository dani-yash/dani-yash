### Hi there, here is what I am currently working on! ⚓️

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an interesting version tower of Hanoi project with 4 pegs instead of 3, using data structures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various data structures, operating systems and UX/UI development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a UI design and analysis project
- 🤔 I’m looking for more practice with data structures and related problems.
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are 293 ways to make change for a dollar (Moral: If there's a will, there's a way!)
